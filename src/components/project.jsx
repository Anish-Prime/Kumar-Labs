                  TH17 CELLS AND INDUCTION OF TISSUE INFLAMMATION

                IL-17-producing Th17 cells are considered to be the most potent effector T cell for inducing tissue inflammation in both experimental autoimmune disease models and in humans. Th17 cells produce IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21 and IL-22, thereby inducing a massive tissue reaction owing to the broad distribution of the IL-17 and IL-22 receptors on parenchymal tissues. Our laboratory was among the first to identify differentiation factors for Th17 cells. We showed that TGF-beta plus IL-6 or IL-21 together induces differentiation and amplification of Th17 differentiation, but it is IL-23 that stabilizes their development and evokes a pathogenic phenotype in differentiating Th17 cells. By undertaking a high-density temporal transcriptomic analysis, in collaboration with the investigators at the Broad Institute, our laboratory was the first to develop a regulatory network for the development of Th17 cells. Our laboratory also identified pathogenic and nonpathogenic Th17 cells that may have different functions in inducing inflammation vs. tissue homeostasis. Elucidation of the effects of these different Th17 cell subsets on disease is a major research effort in the laboratory.

                  ROLE OF TIM-3 AND OTHER CO-INHIBITORY RECEPTORS

                Co-inhibitory receptors, also called check-point receptors, have received considerable attention as blockade of these receptors, such as PD-1 and CTLA-4, has proven to be an effective immunotherapeutic strategy against cancer. In chronic viral infections and cancer, the sustained expression of co-inhibitory receptors on CD8+ T cells is associated with dysfunctional or “exhausted” phenotype. Moreover, the accumulation of co-inhibitory-receptors on CD8+ T cells correlates with increased dysfunction. Although co-inhibitory receptors clearly have a role in T cell dysfunction, how these co-inhibitory molecules are induced on effector T cells is not known. In addition to chronic viral infections and cancer, dysregulation of co-inhibitory pathways is also implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis.

                T cell immunoreceptor with Immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) is a co-inhibitory receptor expressed on activated CD4+, CD8+, and NK T cells, which binds to two ligands, CD155 and CD112, expressed on antigen presenting cells. The laboratory has been working on the mechanisms by which TIGIT mediates inhibition of T cell responses. In addition to inducing IL-10+ DCs, we showed that TIGIT also has cell intrinsic inhibitory effects. TIGIT also directs the suppressor function of Foxp3+Tregs towards Th1 and Th17 cells while sparing Th2 cells from Treg mediated inhibition. Currently, we are investigating how the expression of each of these molecules is regulated and how they each achieve their inhibitory effects in T cells. We are further identifying new inhibitory receptors on T cells using systems biology approaches.

                 Autoimmune Disease Model: The laboratory has generated numerous models that recapitulates disease pathogenesis for the study of multiple sclerosis in mouse models. The laboratory generated a TcR transgenic mouse that harbors reactivity to myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) and differentially develops disease on different genetic backgrounds. The 2D2 TcR transgenic mouse that harbors reactivity against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is the “gold standard” in the field of CNS autoimmunity. The 1C6 TcR transgenic mouse is the only model that recapitulates the transition of relapsing-remitting disease to chronic progressive disease that is observed in MS patients. These models are widely used in the laboratory and in the field as tools to facilitate studies of immune mechanisms of autoimmune disease pathogenesis.
